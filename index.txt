Building the full-stack web application with Django for user management, role-based authentication, and API development was crucial. I also learned about performance evaluation for computer vision models (True Positives, False Positives, accuracy) and the challenges of handling diverse real-world image data, including variations in ethnicity and cosmetic changes.","achievements":["Successfully integrated Viola-Jones for robust face detection and FaceNet for accurate facial recognition, converting faces into 128-D embeddings for efficient database comparison.","Developed a Django web application with secure role-based authentication, allowing teachers to upload photos, students to view attendance, and admins to manage classes and student rolls.","Achieved a high statistical accuracy of 92.15% in automated attendance marking, demonstrating the system's effectiveness across various group sizes.","Significantly reduced the average time taken for teachers to record class attendance by approximately 10 minutes per class through automation."],"future":"Future plans include enhancing the neural network's training dataset to better capture diverse features, incorporating more advanced Postgres array features for faster distance calculations, and expanding functionalities for students, such as providing class leaders access to upload photos for attendance marking.","extra":"A key finding during development was that careful pre-training and robust algorithms like FaceNet were essential for achieving high accuracy, especially when dealing with group photos and diverse facial features. Comparative analysis showed CNN's superior performance over HOG in various detection scenarios."},"links":{"repo":"https://github.com/hkrish28/AttendanceMgmtAI"},"screenshots":[],"tags":["Python","Django","OpenCV","FaceNet","PostgreSQL","Machine Learning","Image Processing","AI"]}]}],["$","$L9",null,{"title":"Skills","className":"text-white","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div","0",{"children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"item-heading","children":"Languages & Web Technologies"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","li","0",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"React"}],["$","li","1",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Java"}],["$","li","2",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Python"}],["$","li","3",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"SQL"}],["$","li","4",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"NoSQL"}],["$","li","5",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Node"}],["$","li","6",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"HTML"}],["$","li","7",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"CSS"}],["$","li","8",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"JavaScript"}],["$","li","9",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Scala"}],["$","li","10",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"C/C++"}]]}]]}],["$","div","1",{"children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"item-heading","children":"Frameworks & Databases"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","li","0",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Hadoop"}],["$","li","1",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Spark"}],["$","li","2",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"TypeScript"}],["$","li","3",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"JUnit"}],["$","li","4",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Jest"}],["$","li","5",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"MySQL"}],["$","li","6",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"MariaDB"}],["$","li","7",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"MongoDB"}],["$","li","8",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Next.js"}],["$","li","9",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"TailwindCSS"}]]}]]}],["$","div","2",{"children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"item-heading","children":"Cloud & Tools"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","li","0",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"AWS"}],["$","li","1",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"PCF"}],["$","li","2",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Linux"}],["$","li","3",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Kubernetes"}],["$","li","4",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Git"}],["$","li","5",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Bitbucket"}],["$","li","6",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"JIRA"}],["$","li","7",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Docker"}],["$","li","8",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Postman"}],["$","li","9",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"JMeter"}],["$","li","10",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Terraform"}],["$","li","11",{"className":"skill-badge","children":"Figma"}]]}]]}]]}]}],["$","$Lb",null,{"certifications":[{"name":"AWS Educate Introduction to Generative AI","provider":"Amazon Web Services Training and Certification","date":"June 2025","link":"https://www.credly.com/badges/23980d71-1582-4653-a69a-f81d34671370"},{"name":"Automating Real-World Tasks with Python","provider":"Google via Coursera","date":"Novemeber 2020","link":"https://coursera.org/share/f103e7564253be99bb424abcd6e22b5b"}]}],["$","$Lc",null,{}]]}],["$","$Ld",null,{"children":"$Le"}],[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/e74d4dd3b5f1ebd1.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","$Lf",null,{"children":["$L10","$L11",["$","$L12",null,{"promise":"$@13"}]]}]]}],{},null,false]},null,false],["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$1","5-cwPutA1gV_QZ9GRF95W",{"children":[["$","$L14",null,{"children":"$L15"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"next-size-adjust","content":""}]]}],null]}],false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$16","$undefined"],"s":false,"S":true}
